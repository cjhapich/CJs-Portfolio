This is where I'll upload code I think is cool and/or useful

## [Project 1: Solar System Birthday Calculator](https://github.com/cjhapich/other_worlds_code)

### Overview
* Created a calculator that takes a date of birth and returns the date of the next birthday for 10 worlds in the solar system (the 8 planets and dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres)
* Calculator also returns the next half birthday (when someone is N + 0.5 years old), the current age, the length of the year, and the length of the birth week on each world
* Project required analysis of the Gregorian calendar system: since the Gregorian year drifts by a non-integer number of days and corrections are only made by adding single whole days, the calculated next birthday on Earth can be off by as much as 2 days. A brief analysis is provided in the repository
